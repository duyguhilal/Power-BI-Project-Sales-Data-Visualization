In this Power BI project, data modeling and transformation operations were first carried out. In this step, the data set was analyzed and various calculations were made using Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. Then, the data model that forms the basis of the project was created and the relationships between the tables were determined. Using keys and attributes, relationships were established and the data model was tailored to fit the analysis and visualization needs.

As the second stage, data cleaning and transformation operations were carried out. The data set was examined, inconsistencies, errors and missing values ​​were identified, and these problems were corrected and the data was cleaned. The data was then tailored to the analysis objectives and visualization requirements using various data transformation techniques.

In the next phase of the project, a suitable dashboard page was created. This dashboard page provided a summary of the data set, enabling users to understand the data more easily. Using visual elements and graphs, key data points were highlighted and analysis results were visually represented.

With the completion of these steps, the basis of the project was created and the data set was made ready for analysis and visualization. Project files include the dataset, modeling and cleanup tasks, project questions, security tasks, Power BI Service publishing steps, and a PowerPoint report template.
